## Project description

The calculator is an advanced math calculator with a wide variety of math problems that can be solved with just a few inputs from the user. The calculator does all the work by taking the user's input based on what type of math and function they selected at the start-up menu. These types include arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. After the user makes their selection, the program will then prompt the user to enter the necessary inputs to solve their problem.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./project
python setup.py
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
