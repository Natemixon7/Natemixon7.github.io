===============

-   **Class:** CSCI 325
-   **Grade:** A
-   **Language(s):** Java
-   **Source Code Repository:** [Natemixon7/AdvancedCalculator3000](https://github.com/Natemixon7/AdvancedCalculator3000)  
    (Please [email me](mailto:NRMixon@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

## Project description

This advanced mathematical calculator is designed to solve a wide range of problems with minimal input from the user. It operates by guiding users through a streamlined process based on the type of mathematical function selected from the start-up menu. Available options include arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. Once a selection is made, the calculator prompts the user to provide the required inputs and performs the computations to deliver accurate solutions efficiently.

## How to compile and run the program

```bash
cd AdvancedCalculator3000
code .
click run (play button) in top right of VS code
```

## UI Design

Once the calculator is run it will display the welcome screen. There you have 4 different types of calculators to choose from (see Fig 1). The first calculator is the arithmetic and it has 5 different types of math you can perform on the 2 numbers the user inputs (see Fig 2). Users can go back to the beginning anytime by typing 'q' (see Fig 3). The next calculator is the algebra calculator. It has 4 different operations the user can select after typing in their quadratic equation (see Fig 4). The third calculator is the geometric calculator where users will be prompted to enter a shape to perform a selected number of operations based on the shape (see Fig 5). At any point during one of the selected calculators, the user can input 'h' to receive more specific instructions to guide them (see Fig 6). The last calculator is trigonometry and has 7 different operations such as converting degrees to radians and finding the missing angles of a triangle (see Fig 7).

## 3. Additional Considerations

This program was done completely in Java as a group project. It features math anywhere from basic to advanced. Adding additional operations or calculators would be quick and easy.
