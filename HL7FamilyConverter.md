## Project description

This tool processes HL7/XML files representing a patient's family relationships, enabling users to export updated XML/HL7 files that reflect added patients or restructured data. It is particularly beneficial for medical staff tasked with generating genealogy trees and streamlining workflows by allowing the reuse of existing XML/HL7 files without the need for manual file creation. The tool also includes features for modifying individual data, such as date of passing, relationship codes, and age, ensuring accuracy and flexibility in managing patient information.

## How to run the program

```bash
Have XML/HL7 files ready
Download the folder to your computer
Unzip the folder
Double-click the HL7_Family_Tree_Converter_v1.0.exe file
```

## 3. Additional Considerations

This tool only works for XML/HL7 files. It will not overwrite original files and instead generate new files.
