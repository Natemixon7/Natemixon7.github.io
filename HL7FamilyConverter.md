## Project description

This tool processes HL7/XML files representing a patient's family relationships, enabling users to export updated XML/HL7 files that reflect added patients or restructured data. It is particularly beneficial for medical staff tasked with generating genealogy trees and streamlining workflows by allowing the reuse of existing XML/HL7 files without the need for manual file creation. The tool also includes features for modifying individual data, such as date of passing, relationship codes, and age, ensuring accuracy and flexibility in managing patient information.
