## Project description

A tool that takes users' HL7/XML files that represent a patient's family relationships and then is able to export new XML/HL7 files based on any added patients or reorientation of the data. This tool is most helpful for medical staff trying to generate genealogy trees for their patients. This allows them to reuse XML/HL7 files without having to create new ones manually. It also comes with features for adjusting each person's data such as the date of their passing, relationship code, and age.  

## How to run the program

```bash
Have XML/HL7 files ready
Download the folder to your computer
Unzip the folder
Double-click the HL7_Family_Tree_Converter_v1.0.exe file
```

## 3. Additional Considerations

This tool only works for XML/HL7 files. It will not overwrite your original files and will generate new files instead.
